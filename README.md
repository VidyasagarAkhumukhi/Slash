## Development Log

### **August 2025: Initial World Creation**

The project began with the creation of the world's foundation. Using Unreal's landscape tools, a 32x32 km grid was sculpted, and a multi-layered landscape material was created to blend different PBR textures and form the initial biomes.

### **Update: August 26, 2025 - Foliage and Atmosphere**

High-quality assets from Quixel Megascans were introduced using the foliage system to paint trees, grass, and rocks across the landscape. The atmosphere was dramatically enhanced with a Post-Processing Volume, adding effects like volumetric god rays and a cinematic golden hour.

### **Update: August 28, 2025 - World Redesign & Grand Scale**

A significant art direction shift led to a redesign of the world into a vast desert canyon with a lush oasis at its center. To create a massive sense of scale, large backdrop meshes were added to form distant, impassable canyon walls, grounding the world in an epic, cinematic environment.

### **Update: August 28, 2025 - Ancient Ruins & Dungeons**

Marking a transition from broad landscape creation to detailed level design, the first point of interest has been added to the world: a dungeon entrance. These ancient ruins, seamlessly integrated into the natural rock of the canyon walls, will serve as a gateway to the challenges and secrets that lie beneath the desert sands.
