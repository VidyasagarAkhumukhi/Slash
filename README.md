# The Slayer of Demons - A World in the Making

Welcome to the development repository for my upcoming game, built in **Unreal Engine 5**. This README serves as a living document and devlog, tracking the progress from the initial world-building to the final gameplay mechanics.

## Development Log

### **August 2025: Initial World Creation**

The initial phase of development focused on creating the game world's landscape. Using Unreal Engine's powerful toolset, a 32x32 grid was transformed into a unique and explorable environment through three key stages: sculpting, texturing, and basic lighting.

* **1. Sculpting the Foundation:** The terrain was shaped to create a foundation with varied elevations, including mountains, plains, and interesting natural formations.
* **2. Painting with Landscape Layers:** Custom landscape material layers were created to paint different biomes (sand, grass, rock) directly onto the terrain.
* **3. Bringing the World to Life:** Basic lighting and a sky atmosphere were added to establish the initial in-game look and feel.

### **Update: August 26, 2025 - Foliage and Atmosphere**

The landscape has been brought to life with the addition of foliage and a significant overhaul of the world's lighting.

Using Unreal Engine's foliage system, a variety of assets including trees, grasses, and rocks have been procedurally placed and hand-painted across the terrain. To dramatically enhance the visual mood, post-processing volumes were introduced to control color grading, bloom, and atmospheric effects. This update adds volumetric **god rays** that filter through the trees and a cinematic **golden hour** lighting setup.
