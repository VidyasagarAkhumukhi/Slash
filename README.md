# [The Slayer of Demons] - A World in the Making

Welcome to the development repository for my upcoming game, built in **Unreal Engine 5**. This README serves as a living document and devlog, tracking the progress from the initial world-building to the final gameplay mechanics.

## Current Progress: Landscape & World Design

The initial phase of development has focused on creating the game world's landscape. Using Unreal Engine's powerful toolset, a 32x32 grid has been transformed into a unique and explorable environment.

The creation process followed three key stages:

### 1. Sculpting the Foundation

The process began with a blank 32x32 landscape. Using the sculpting tools, the terrain was shaped to create a foundation with varied elevations, including mountains, plains, and interesting natural formations. This raw sculpt forms the geological backbone of the world.

### 2. Painting with Landscape Layers

Once the sculpting was complete, the landscape was brought to life with texturing. Custom landscape material layers were created to paint different biomes directly onto the terrain. This allows for natural blending between materials like sand, grass, and rock, creating a believable and diverse environment as seen from an overhead map view.

### 3. Bringing the World to Life

The final step was to establish the in-game atmosphere. With proper lighting, a dynamic sky, and atmospheric effects, the landscape transforms into an immersive environment. This ground-level view demonstrates the final look and feel from the player's perspective, showcasing the detailed textures and the scale of the world.

The landscape has been brought to life with the addition of foliage and a significant overhaul of the world's lighting.

Using Unreal Engine's foliage system, a variety of assets including trees, grasses, and rocks have been procedurally placed and hand-painted across the terrain. To dramatically enhance the visual mood, post-processing volumes were introduced to control color grading, bloom, and atmospheric effects. This update adds volumetric **god rays** that filter through the trees and a cinematic **golden hour** lighting setup.

## Technology Stack

* **Game Engine:** Unreal Engine 5.6
* **Core Tools:** Unreal Engine Landscape and Material Editor

## Next Steps

With the initial landscape established, the next phases of development will focus on:

* [ ] Implementing a playable character controller.
* [ ] Populating the world with foliage, rocks, and other environmental assets.
* [ ] Developing core gameplay mechanics.
* [ ] Designing and implementing a dynamic weather and time-of-day system.

Stay tuned for more updates!
